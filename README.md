# The Flutter Way

A new Flutter project where all the learnings related to the flutter course are implemented. I tried to make all my assignemts available throught different screens and can be access throught navigation.

* Added a Splash Screen
* Added Home Screen with Drawer
* Added a header in drawer to create a gmail UI design and list items for navigation to different screens
* Added ListView for RewardList screen
* Added GridView for RewardList screen in grid design
* Added fontAwesome and Gap packages
* Added About Dialog for App info
* Added bottom bar but its not functional, will add screens to it in next assignment
